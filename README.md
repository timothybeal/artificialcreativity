# artificialcreativity

How might emerging models in deep learning, often discussed by futurists and science fiction writers in terms of “artificial intelligence,” be fruitfully engaged as models of “artificial creativity” that afford critical reflection on analogous processes of human creativity?

The intentionally provocative phrase “artificial creativity” means to question familiar cultural distinctions between human and machine. On the one hand, in common parlance, where "artificial" refers to fakes and copies, the phrase might connote imitating or “faking” human creativity. Are “machine learning” and related forms of generativity simply imitative of human learning and generativity, or are they something more and/or other? On the other hand,  insofar as “artificial” refers to the work of artifice, the phrase is redundant. Is not all creativity, human and/or  machine, in this sense artificial?
